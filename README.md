R script and data to examine the suite of ecosystem and stock structure factors influeincing the recruitment of spring and fall spwaning Atlantic Herring in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. The approach develops GLM models and uses an information theorectic model selection process to identify top models of recruitment and recruitment rate.

Users must adjust data and explanatory variables when applying to their stock of interest.
